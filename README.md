# KnightsTour
Wikipedia: The knight's tour problem is the mathematical problem of finding a knight's tour. Creating a program to find a knight's tour is a common problem given to computer science students. Variations of the knight's tour problem involve chessboards of different sizes than the usual 8 Ã— 8, as well as irregular (non-rectangular) boards.

This project contains simple java codes (based on Warensdorf's rule) which takes a row and a column for start position of tour and then gives you a simple path of knights tour on a chessboard.
